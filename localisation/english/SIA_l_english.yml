 SIA_lack_of_the_political_legitimacy: "Lack of the Political Legitimacy"
 SIA_lack_of_the_political_legitimacy_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_SIA_prayut_coa_cat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThailand’s political legitimacy has been repeatedly questioned due to the unelected Senate, which plays a decisive role in selecting the Prime Minister and influencing governance despite lacking democratic representation. This has created a widespread perception that the Senate serves as a safeguard for certain political groups rather than the public interest. Likewise, the Election Commission has been criticized for alleged bias and lack of transparency, with accusations of manipulating electoral processes to favor particular parties. These factors have significantly eroded public trust in elections as a true reflection of the people’s will.\n\nThe slim majority in the House of Representatives further weakens the government’s stability, forcing it to engage in behind-the-scenes bargaining with smaller parties or independents. This dependency on undemocratic mechanisms—along with the influence of appointed institutions—reinforces the view that political power in Thailand is disconnected from genuine democratic choice. Consequently, public confidence in the legitimacy of the political system continues to deteriorate."
 SIA_an_army_with_a_country_1: "An Army with a Country"
 SIA_an_army_with_a_country_1_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_SIA_army_with_nation_cat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Royal Thai Army is regarded as the nation’s protective shield and a pillar of internal security. Despite facing challenges in adapting to modern warfare, the army continues to rely on traditional strategies and weaponry supported by foreign allies. Training remains rigorous, with an emphasis on discipline over tactical flexibility, resulting in a strong defensive capability but limited expertise in contemporary maneuver warfare. The army also maintains significant influence over national politics and governance, often ensuring that strategic decisions reflect its own interests.\n\nAlthough the Royal Thai Army possesses well-prepared personnel and a stable organizational structure, its reliance on imported weapons and technological limitations prevent it from achieving full effectiveness in modern combat. A centralized command structure and the prioritization of internal power dynamics have hindered the development of long-term strategic planning. Nevertheless, its expertise in domestic operations and its ability to maintain internal order continue to make the Royal Thai Army a force that cannot be underestimated in Southeast Asia."
